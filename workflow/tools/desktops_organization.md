# Desktop Organization Workflow

This document outlines an organized virtual desktop setup for a dual-screen
workstation, designed to enhance productivity and streamline multitasking
across various tasks. Each virtual desktop is dedicated to specific categories
of work, such as coding, terminal usage, communication, API testing, and
personal tools. By assigning distinct functions to each desktop and screen,
this system ensures a clear workflow, reduces distractions, and optimizes the
use of available tools.
