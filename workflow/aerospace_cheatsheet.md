# AeroSpace Quick Cheatsheet

AeroSpace is a tiling window manager for macOS. All keybindings use **Alt** as the main modifier by default.

## Essential Commands

### Window Navigation
- `alt + h/l` - Focus window left/right
- `alt + j/k` - Focus window down/up (only with vertical splits)

### Multi-Monitor
- `ctrl + alt + ,/.` - Focus prev/next monitor
- `ctrl + alt + left/right` - Move window to prev/next monitor (focus follows)

### Workspace Management
- `alt + 1-9` - Go to workspace (jumps to its monitor)
- `alt + shift + 1-9` - Move window to workspace
- `alt + shift + tab` - Move entire workspace to next monitor

### Layout Management
- `alt + /` - Cycle tile layouts (horizontal â†” vertical)
- `alt + ,` - Switch to accordion layout (one window visible)
- `alt + f` - Fullscreen (temporary, resets when switching)
- `alt + shift + f` - macOS native fullscreen

### Window Resizing
- `alt + -/=` - Shrink/grow focused window by 50px

### Service Mode (alt + shift + semicolon to enter)
In service mode, you can use these commands without holding alt:
- `r` - Reset/flatten layout (auto-exits)
- `f` - Toggle floating/tiling (auto-exits)
- `backspace` - Close all except current (auto-exits)
- `esc` - Exit service mode

### Workspace Assignments (Persist After Restart)
- **Monitor 1:** 1,2,3,Q,W,E,A,S,D
- **Monitor 2:** 4,5,6,R,T,Y,F,G,H,V,B,N
- **Monitor 3:** 7,8,9,U,I,O,J,K,L,M

## Quick Setup Tips

1. **Config Location**: `~/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml`
2. **Start on Login**: The app should prompt you to enable this on first launch
3. **Accessibility Permissions**: Grant AeroSpace accessibility permissions in System Settings > Privacy & Security

## Layout Types
- **Tiles**: Windows arranged in a grid (default)
- **Accordion**: Only one window visible at a time in a split
- **Floating**: Windows can overlap and be positioned freely

## Troubleshooting
- If keybindings don't work, check Accessibility permissions
- Run `aerospace reload-config` after editing config
- Check logs: `aerospace list-windows` to debug window issues

## Useful CLI Commands
```bash
aerospace list-workspaces    # List all workspaces
aerospace list-windows       # List all windows
aerospace focus --window-id <id>  # Focus specific window
aerospace move left/right/up/down  # Move windows via CLI
```

## Pro Tips
- Use workspaces to organize different projects or contexts
- Combine with other tools like Raycast or Alfred for app launching
- The service mode is great for one-off adjustments without holding modifiers
- You can customize all keybindings in the config file
