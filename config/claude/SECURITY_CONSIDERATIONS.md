# Claude Code Security Considerations

## Credential and Secret Access Policy

### Current Configuration

As of the current setup, Claude Code is **NOT** configured to deny access to credential and secret files. This is an intentional decision based on the following considerations:

### Rationale for Allowing Access

1. **Development Workflow**: Many development workflows require reading configuration files that may contain credentials or API keys
2. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: Access to environment files and configuration is often necessary for debugging applications
3. **Flexibility**: Overly restrictive access can hinder legitimate development tasks
4. **Context Awareness**: Developers can make informed decisions about when credential access is appropriate

### Security Measures in Place

Instead of blanket denial, we rely on:

1. **Smart Permission Hook**: The `smart_permissions.py` hook will **ask for confirmation** when accessing potentially sensitive files
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Files matching patterns like `.env*`, `secrets/`, `credentials/`, `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, etc. trigger confirmation prompts
3. **Audit Logging**: All file access is logged via the command logger for audit purposes
4. **User Awareness**: Confirmation prompts make users explicitly aware when accessing sensitive files

### Files That Trigger Confirmation Prompts

The following patterns will cause Claude Code to ask for permission before accessing:

- `.env` and `.env.*` files
- Files in `secrets/` or `credentials/` directories  
- SSH keys (`id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, etc.)
- Cloud provider credentials (`.aws/`, `.gcp/`)
- Private keys and certificates (`.pem`, `.p12`, `.pfx`)
- Files containing `private.*key` in the name

### Future Considerations

This policy may be revisited in the future. If stricter security is needed, consider:

1. **Per-Project Configuration**: Enable stricter rules for specific sensitive projects
2. **Environment-Specific Rules**: Different policies for development vs. production environments
3. **Enterprise Policies**: Organization-wide managed settings for credential access
4. **Containerized Isolation**: Use devcontainers for additional isolation when working with sensitive code

### Best Practices

When working with sensitive files:

1. **Review Prompts Carefully**: Always read and understand permission prompts for credential access
2. **Minimize Exposure**: Only grant access when genuinely needed for the task
3. **Use Environment Variables**: Prefer environment variables over hardcoded credentials
4. **Regular Audits**: Review the command logs periodically to understand credential access patterns
5. **Project Isolation**: Use separate Claude sessions for different security contexts

### Related Configuration

- Global permissions: `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Smart permissions hook: `~/.claude/hooks/smart_permissions.py`
- Command logging: `~/.claude/hooks/command_logger.py`
- Audit logs: `.claude/command.log` (per project)
